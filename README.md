# Computer-Vision

This repository contains Python programs for a couple of computer vision paradigms that interested me- Image Warping, and Optical Flow. It was interesting for me to implement the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm from scratch and compare it with the OpenCV implementation.
These programs were part of work done in  the CS6476 Computer Vision class at Georgia Tech.


# Requirements

Packages required for the programs in this repository to run are:

 - NumPy
 - OpenCV Python
